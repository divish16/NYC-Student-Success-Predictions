      <h1>NYC Student Success Predictions</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The question we are hoping to answer is, "Can demographic information be used to predict student success outcomes?"</p>
          <p>We selected this topic because education is important to all the members of our group, and we are interested in learning more about the relationship between the demographics and resourcing of a school and its success outcomes.</p>
          <p>We will be combining three datasets with information regarding New York City schools: two datasets contain demographic and poverty information (including information regarding race, gender, economic status, etc.), and the third contains information related to student success. All datasets contain a column with unique school identification codes, and the tables can be joined on this column. The source for both datasets is NYCOpenData.

          A provisional join on a small sample of these datasets (preserving the full set of features) is available as a CSV in the Machine Learning folder of this repository.</p>
